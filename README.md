ski_website
This website is created using Django. It is a ski trip planner that has a variety of features that I implemented to strengthen my skills. These include:

- Dependent drop down menus and forms
- The use of API's to display weather at current day's specific location
- JS alerts
- Use of bootstrap html elements and alerts
