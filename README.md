<h3><b>ski_website</b></h3>
This website is created using Django. It is a ski trip planner that has a variety of features that I implemented to strengthen my skills. These include:

- Dependent drop down menus and forms
- The use of API's to display weather at current day's specific location
- JS alerts
- Use of bootstrap html elements and alerts

The website allows users to create trips to ski destinations and plan each day out. Depending on the destination, the user will have certain options for which ski resorts they can ski at. Alongisde this, the website tracks past, present, and futre trips and also gives the user a daily itinerary with the weather at the specific resort they are skiing at.
